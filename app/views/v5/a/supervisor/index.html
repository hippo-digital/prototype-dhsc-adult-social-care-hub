    <div class="govuk-grid-row">
      <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
        <p>Poonam has worked in social care since leaving school, and now is a senior care and support worker within a supported living setting with responsibility for both advanced care and leading and managing a team of care and support workers. She completed her Lead Adult Care Worker apprenticeship 2 years ago, which included a Level 3 Diploma in Care.</p>
        <p>In her role, she has responsibility for the performance management and leadership of her team, and has to mentor more junior care and support workers and coach her team to provide quality care and support. In her development plan with her manager, she identified the need to develop skills around supervision, coaching and mentoring as well as developing her interest in leadership skills.</p>
        <p>She is thinking about her future career opportunities now. She has the experience and knowledge to be able to concentrate on a specialist area of care, developing more in-depth knowledge and skills to support people with a range of support needs, or she could choose to develop her management and leadership skills and aim to become a registered manager. Both options provide opportunities to advance her career and to develop her learning and skills further.</p>
        <p>Poonam will use her annual appraisal as an opportunity to discuss these options with her manager and look at where she might develop. Each option will provide her with a challenge in terms of her development, but Poonam enjoys learning and likes the motivation of supporting not only those who use care services but also her colleagues who are developing in their own roles and seeing them gain more skills.</p>
        <p>Whichever path Poonam chooses, she will be making a difference to people, supporting them to live their best lives, something that gives her great job satisfaction.</p>
