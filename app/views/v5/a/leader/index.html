    <div class="govuk-grid-row">
      <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
        <p>Kelly is a team leader in a supported living service for people with a learning disability. She really enjoys working with the people who live in the service, she knows them really well and has very good relationships with them and their families. Kelly has worked in the service for a few years now after starting her career in adult social care working in a residential home with another organisation.</p>
        <p>During her time with her previous employer, she completed both the Care Certificate and the Level 3 Diploma in Care qualifications along with a number of accredited training courses to help develop her general practice as well as her specific knowledge around supporting people with learning disabilities.</p>
        <p>After reviewing her previous qualifications and training against the care workforce pathway, her new employer recognised and accepted all of her previous learning - avoiding the need to repeat anything.</p>
        <p>While discussing her development and future career goals with her line manager, Kelly realises she is passionate about continuing to develop her specialist knowledge and is really good at getting the best out of her team. She discusses a career in management with her line manager but realises that is not for her. Instead, they explore the practice leader role category so Kelly can continue to develop her area of practice and support others to do the same. Kelly would also like to increase her specialist knowledge in sensory impairments and communication as this is a particular area of support for one person she is currently supporting.</p>
        <p>Kelly and her manager put together a personal development plan. This has been mapped against her previous learning and qualifications and Tier 3 of the Core Capabilities Framework for Supporting People with a Learning Disability. Her manager also supports her to complete a specialist qualification at Level 4 to help develop further her practice leadership skills and knowledge. Following completion of her qualification, Kelly takes on the responsibility of leading practice within the supported living house, supporting her colleagues to develop their own practice, identifying and closing skills gaps, and engaging with the wider social care sector so she can ensure her own practice continues to be at the forefront of what is expected within her specialism.</p>
